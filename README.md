# _Address Book_

#### _Webpage to hold address book, 2.10.17_

#### By _**Katy Daviscourt**_

## Description

_This is a webpage that allows you to store addresses in an address book. You can add new addresses, click on individual addresses to see their details, and clear all addresses to wipe the slate clean and start again._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Open page at localhost:5004_
* _add a new address_
* _see your address book_
* _click on any of the addresses to see their details_
* _clear all addresses if you feel like it_

## Known Bugs

* _I can't figure out how to make the search results into a link to that person's detailed address._
* _If you leave any of the forms blank on the add a new address page, the server returns a 500 error (fixed with "required" in the input tag, but that doesn't seem like the simplest fix)._
* _Replacing hrefs with buttons seems to do something strange to the links; it will take it to the correct url but the cshtml file won't load._
